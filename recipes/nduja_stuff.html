        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425˚F and lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Roasted Garlic Honey: Place garlic head in a small sheet of tin foil, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with salt and rosemary leaves. Seal foil, crimping at the top to close, roast until tender and caramelized about 30-40 minutes. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic into a bowl, mashing as needed with a fork. Stream in honey and stir in Calabrian chiles until smooth, season with a few cracks of black pepper. Honey will keep in a jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. </li>
            <li>‘Nduja Stuffing: In a bowl whisk together goat cheese, ricotta, garlic, and lemon zest until smooth. Stir in ‘Nduja, fresh herbs, season with salt, pepper and olive oil until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Stuff Chicken: Separating skin from breasts and thighs to create a pocket for the filling. Spoon (or pipe) filling into each breast, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Place chicken on prepared baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, on middle rack in oven.</li>
            <li>Prepare Potatoes: Toss peewee potatoes in a bowl along with meyer lemon slices, spring onions, and season with salt, pepper, and 3-4 tablespoons of roasted garlic honey. Toss to coat and scatter on a baking sheet. Place in oven near the top rack and roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and beautifully caramelized, shaking pan occasionally. </li>
            <li>Check chicken, draining reserved juices off and reserve, mixing with honey or as a jus for serving. Baste chicken and continue to roast for 20-30 minutes. Baste regularly until chicken skin is shiny, caramelized and chicken is cooked through,</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, prepare crispy garlic slices - heating olive oil in a small pot over medium heat to 325˚F. Quickly fry garlic chips until golden about 2 minutes, stirring to ensure even cooking. Scoop out with a slotted spoon to drain off excess oil and cool on a paper towel and sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>For the salad: toss warm potatoes into a large bowl with dijon mustard, sherry vinegar, and haricot vert. Season with salt and pepper, tossing to coat. Just before serving, toss together with lettuce leaves and fine herbs. Sample greens, seasoning with more vinegar, (or fresh meyer lemon juice) salt and pepper as needed. Serve crisp salad alongside stuffed chicken breasts, garnishing with crispy garlic chips, crumbled goat cheese and zest of meyer lemon.</li>
